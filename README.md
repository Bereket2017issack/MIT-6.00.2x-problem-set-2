# MIT-6.00.2x-
This is a problem set given in MITx-6.00.2x It is pretty awesome to to give it a try and answer the question

Problem 1

In this problem you will implement the RectangularRoom class. For this class, decide what fields you will use and decide how the following operations are to be performed:

Initializing the object
Marking an appropriate tile as cleaned when a robot moves to a given position (casting floats to ints - and/or the function math.floor - may be useful to you here)
Determining if a given tile has been cleaned
Determining how many tiles there are in the room
Determining how many cleaned tiles there are in the room
Getting a random position in the room
Determining if a given position is in the room
Complete the RectangularRoom class by implementing its methods in ps2.py.

Although this problem has many parts, it should not take long once you have chosen how you wish to represent your data. For reasonable representations, a majority of the methods will require only a couple of lines of code.

Hint: During debugging, you might want to use random.seed(0) so that your results are reproducible.
